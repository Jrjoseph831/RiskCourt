Project: RiskCourt — quant-style NBA analytics terminal (no betting).

Hard rules:
- No wagering features, no sportsbook scraping, no private endpoint reverse engineering.
- Odds only from licensed odds API or user-entered odds.
- No user-submitted code execution.
- Keep UI terminal-like: modern, minimal, dense but calm.

Working rules:
- Before coding, list exact files to change and acceptance criteria.
- Use TypeScript, strong typing, and zod validation for any external inputs.
- Prefer small, testable steps and minimal diffs.
- Return full file contents for modified files.
- For Supabase: provide SQL + dashboard directions.
