# RiskCourt — Vision

One-liner
RiskCourt is a quant-style NBA analytics terminal that estimates fair lines and helps you manage risk across a portfolio of picks (no betting, just decision support).

Mission
Give everyday bettors the same decision discipline quants use: fair value, uncertainty, and portfolio risk controls — presented in a sleek terminal UX.

Who it’s for (v1)
- Serious casual bettors who already place bets elsewhere and want a research-grade second opinion
- Users who are tired of “picks content” and want math + risk + tracking

What we deliver (core promise)
- Fair lines (fair win probability / fair spread / fair total)
- Edge vs market (de-vig implied probability vs model probability)
- Uncertainty (confidence bands + sensitivity to line movement)
- Portfolio controls (stake sizing, max daily risk, exposure caps, correlation warnings)
- Receipts (backtests + paper-trading performance + auditability)

What we are not
- Not a sportsbook
- Not a bet placement tool
- Not a scraping tool
- Not “guaranteed winners” or “AI lock picks”

Differentiation (how we win)
Competitors often win on: odds screens, instant EV feeds, props volume, social tracking.
RiskCourt wins on:
1) portfolio-grade risk engine (max daily loss, exposure, correlation)
2) robustness + reproducibility (walk-forward, season splits, parameter stability, calibration)
3) terminal-grade UX (dense but calm tables, fast filters, consistent explainability)

Success metrics (MVP)
- Activation: user creates 1 strategy and analyzes 3 picks in first session
- Retention: user returns 3+ days/week during NBA season
- Trust: users can explain “why” a recommendation exists using our panels
- Economics: odds API costs stay within free/low tier due to caching
