For every new feature, answer:

1) What competitor bucket does this compete with?
- Odds screens / EV feeds
- Model/picks customization
- Tracking/social

2) Why would a user choose RiskCourt instead?
Must strengthen at least one wedge:
- portfolio risk controls
- robustness/reproducibility
- terminal UX clarity

3) What proof does the UI show?
- backtest receipts
- uncertainty bands
- sensitivity thresholds
- auditability/versioning

If a feature doesn’t improve wedge or proof, it’s deprioritized.
