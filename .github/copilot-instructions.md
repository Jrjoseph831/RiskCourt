You are working on RiskCourt: a quant-style NBA analytics terminal that estimates fair lines and helps manage risk across a portfolio of picks. This is not a sportsbook.

Constraints:
- No bet placement, no deposits/withdrawals, no sportsbook linking.
- Do not scrape sportsbooks or use private sportsbook endpoints.
- Odds only from a licensed odds API or user-entered odds.
- No user-submitted code execution.

Preferences:
- Modern Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui.
- Strong typing, zod validation, clean error states.
- Small diffs, minimal moving parts, reproducible computations.
